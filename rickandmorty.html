<p>To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand <span class="group">Rick and Morty</span>. 
The <span class="humour">humour</span> is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of <span class="skill">theoretical physics</span> 
most of the <span class="jokes">jokes</span> will go over a typical <span class="viewer">viewer</span>'s head. 
There's also <span class="character">Rick</span>'s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - 
his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The <span class="fans">fans</span>
 understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these <span class="jokes2">jokes</span>, 
 to realize that they're not just <span class="funny">funny</span>- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike 
 <span class="group">Rick and Morty</span> truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the <span class="humour">humour</span> 
 in Rick's existencial catchphrase "<span class="catchphrase">Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,</span>" 
 which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of 
 those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as <span class="creator">Dan Harmon</span>'s genius unfolds 
 itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. ðŸ˜‚ And yes by the way, I DO have a <span class="group">Rick and
 Morty</span> tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 
 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.</p>
