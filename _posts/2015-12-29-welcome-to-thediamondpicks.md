Welcome to my personal website. I hope you find it helpful and informative. Some of you may remember the 1 page template horror that was my previous site so I have completely revamped it. 

## Specs

I couldn't resist posting specs of the website so here they are:

-   Jekyll System that proceeses the header and footer and makes them appear on every page along with universal styling rules.

-   Jekyll again which allows me to post blog posts in the amazing Markdown format and then automagically syncing them with my local site.

-   Git enables me to quickly commit changes to the GitHub repo.

-   GitHub pages which a) Gives me free hosting and a free .github.io domain but also b) allows me to commit changes quickly and effiently.

Now on to the stuff you can see:

-   TEMPLATED/Cloud Canon's Linear design which I have based by website off of.

-   Font Awesome which is a free to use font image tool (Like Windings) that works awesomely for things like the globe icons.

-   Not to mention countless pieces of code that has been used in making this site.

Nevertheless thanks for visiting and have a happy new year!
