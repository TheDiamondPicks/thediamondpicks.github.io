						<h2>ItsJerryAndHarry</h2>
					</header>
					<p>ItsJerryAndHarry is a medimum sized Minecraft network with a flourishing (yet occasionally toxic) community. Unlike other server owners the owners (ItsJerry and ItsHarry) remain active on the forums but not so much on the server. Built on the backbone on their highly successful YouTube channels they have hit that "sweet spot" with fun, original minigames that attract a more mature audience. It is the website where I spend a majority of my time. I have been on the J&H network for about two years and I am still extremely active there.</p>

						<h2>XenoForums/Server</h2>
					</header>
					<p>I joined the XenoNetwork in June 2015 and after around a week I applied to become staff. I was quickly promoted to the now defunct Trusted rank. I was subsequeitly promoted through the heirachy and have now become an Owner there. My notable achievments are overhauling staff applications and revamping the rules.</p>

						<h2>SpigotMC</h2>
					</header>
					<p>SpigotMC is a website mainly focused around the "Spigot" Minecraft server software. It was created in 2012 as a high-performance fork of CraftBukkit (Formerly the most popular Minecraft server software). Eventually CraftBukkit as a project was shut down but Spigot decided to take the reigns and update both CraftBukkit and Spigot. The amount I am active on here is only seconded to ItsJerryAndHarry. I remain on here to fix bugs and download plugins for Ultra Arcade.</p>

						<h2>Bukkit</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Once the forefront of the Minecraft Server modding the community recently this once flourishing community has had a turn for the worse after the project's lead EvilSeph shutdown the project and once it was revived by Mojang it was hit with a highly damaging DMCA. I am no longer active there as the community is very barren and hateful.</p>
